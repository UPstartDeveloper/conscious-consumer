# Release Schedule

## About this Document
All releases are scheduled to go live by 7 P.M. P.S.T.

**Important**: All versions up to 0.1.1 are scheduled to go live *without* automated tests having been written yet. This is to accomodate the fast-pace of Zain's Intensive at Make School; and once the Intensive is over Zain plans to go back and write tests for the site. Pull requests are also *greatly appreciated* during this time as well!

I am new to open source web development, and want to be as transparent as possible.

**Thank you for your understanding** - Zain :)
