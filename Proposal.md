# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**Name:**
Zain Raza


**Project Name:**
Conscious Consumer


**Is your project New or Old?**
New


**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

How do you begin to address climate change? All over the world more and more people are becoming interested in living more sustainable lifestyles, and the question they ask themselves is always, *"where do I begin?"*
Conscious Consumer is the tool for the individual who's goal focused - just as we budget our finances to keep track of spending, or follow diet plans to help control our consumption of food, this product helps users to set monthly goals for their carbon footprint, and to interact with green alternative products that can help them in achieving their carbon consumption goals.
During this intensive I plan to move the project through several iterations:
mainly there will be a feature for users to set a carbon budget for each area of their lives (transportation, living, environmental waste to start), another feature for them to be able to track how they are doing on their goals, and a marketplace feature for them to view green products (for example, soccer balls that use the kinetic energy from daytime play, to electricity to power the home at night).

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
1. I need to do research on where people's emissions come from in detail
2. I need to look at material design resources to make a marketplace feature that's user-friendly
3. I need to look deeply into how to integrate payments using the Stripe transportation
4. I need to design how I will show users how they are doing on their goals, and how to reward them for staying on track

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**

User is able to do a CRUD of the goals for their monthly emissions budget.

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**

User is able to be authenticated, and on sign up they can set up a profile for the types of green products for which they are interested in receiving recommendations.

## Car
**ONE additional feature**

User is able to see a marketplace of the latest products in green living, and can buy one from a third party seller (links them to another page). If it's a product by the site itself, we will process the payment on our own site.


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1

1. **Goal 1:** Learn more about climate change by designing a carbon budgeting feature that is intuitive to use and gives a sense of how much we are all emitting month by month.
2. **Goal 2:**
Improve at using the Django REST Framework and Chart.js frameworks, to be able to create data visualizations that are production-worthy.
3. **Goal 3:**
Improve at UI/UX by following material design best practices for the site.
